# House-price-prediction
A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on features like location, size, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Implemented Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to achieve accurate predictions. Users can train the model on their dataset and predict new house prices efficiently.

## Overview
This project predicts **house prices** based on features like **location, size, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms** using **Machine Learning**. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions with Python.

## Features
- Predict house prices using **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**.
- Handle categorical data (like Location) using **one-hot encoding**.
- Evaluate model performance using **MSE** and **RÂ² score**.
- Option to predict prices for new houses by entering custom features.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn
